### The Simple Rule

You can choose one of these :wink: :

- Create a simple code in **/helloworld** to print *"Hello World"* in you favourite programming language
- Create a simple code in **/sqrt** to calculate a *square root of number* in your favourite programming language
- Create a **recursion factorial function** in **/factorial_recursion** to calculate a *factorial of number* in your favourite programming language
- Create a **interation factorial function** in **/factorial_iteration** to calculate a *factorial of number* in your favourite programming language

I've add some example in those folder, go check it

**:warning: The duplicate code / programming language type is not accepted and will not be merged**
